### Instructions on how to interact with the work

After refreshing the page, the positions of 500 balls on the canvas will randomly appear at any position on the canvas, and their fill colors will change arbitrarily.

After these balls appear, they will continuously move to the right, and at the same time, they will also move irregularly up and down under the influence of Perlin noise. When the ball touches the right side of the canvas, it will reappear on the left side and continue to move irregularly up and down under the influence of Perlin noise while moving to the right.

The 4 big circles with several concentric circles on the drawing board will also move irregularly up and down or left and right under the influence of Perlin noise. They move at different speeds.



### Details of your individual approach to animating the group code.

- Which did you choose to drive your individual code:
Perlin noise.



- Which properties of the image will be animated and how:

Multiple small balls on the drawing board will move irregularly left and right while moving upwards.
There are four large circles with concentric circles on the drawing board, which will move irregularly within a certain range. But their speed of movement is different. Meanwhile, the large circles in the upper left and lower right corners move forward and backward towards the center, the large circles in the upper right corner move left and right, and the large circles in the lower left corner move up and down.



- References to inspiration for animating your individual code:

Our group members have finalized four large circles with concentric rings and multiple small balls behind them. The method I chose was Perlin noise and randomness, so I thought about what I should do.
Then I found inspiration in countless balloons flying upwards. A balloon that flies upwards will fly upwards in a vertical direction. Meanwhile, these balloons will move irregularly left and right. So I made an animation of the originally stationary ball, similar to an upward flying balloon. They can move irregularly left and right while moving upwards under the influence of Perlin noise. In order to maintain the animation effect, these balls will reappear at the bottom of the canvas and continue to move upwards after touching the upper edge of the canvas.
As for the four large circles with concentric circles on the drawing board, my inspiration comes from balloons tied with ropes. They will move irregularly within a certain range. So I set four of them to move within a certain range. But their speed of movement is different. Meanwhile, the large circles in the upper left and lower right corners move forward and backward towards the center, the large circles in the upper right corner move left and right, and the large circles in the lower left corner move up and down.

- A short technical explanation of how your individual code works to animate the image and any appropriate references:

The changes I made to the group code include the addition of Perlin noise function and if function.
I did not use any tools or techniques outside of the course.
I didn't copy some technology from the Internet.
